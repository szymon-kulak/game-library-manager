# GameState - Game Library Manager

GameState is a must have tool for any gamer with a sizeable library. 

Ever felt overwhelmed by the amount of games in your Steam Library? 

Ever bought the same game twice on different platforms because you forgot you already own it somewhere else? 

Ever couldn't decide what to play?

GameState aims to solve these problems. 

## ü§î Why does this exist?

I'm building GameState to solve one of the biggest problems I have as a gamer - a backlog of games so enormous that I often don't play any games at all due to choice paralysis. 

I know I'm not alone with this problem - there is a reason why videos like [this](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=nkgAlnDIPMU&t=1664s&pp=ygUOZ2FtaW5nIGJhY2tsb2c%3D) and [this one](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IKvcEmh8YFY&pp=ygUOZ2FtaW5nIGJhY2tsb2c%3D) get hundreds of thousands of views on YouTube. 

That's why I'm building GameState - to catalogue and track the state of your backlog, as well as make choosing what to play next a breeze.
